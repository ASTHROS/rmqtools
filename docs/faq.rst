Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

- Is Rmqtools threaded?

    The high-level API in the Rmqtools library, ``RmqConnection`` contains
    mostly threaded methods, while the underlying classes are not threaded,
    but can be threaded if desired. The important thing to remember when
    threading is that each thread must have a unique connection, created in
    that thread. See :doc:`/modules/rmq` for more details.
