Welcome to Rmqtools!
====================
Rmqtools provides enhanced features for RabbitMQ development in Python. It is
based on the Pika_ library.

If you have not developed with Rmqtools, Pika, or RabbitMQ before, the
:doc:`intro` documentation is a good place to get started.

Installing Rmqtools
-------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Pika (`version 1.3.0+ <https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installing-pika>`_)
* RabbitMQ (`version 3.12.0+ <https://rabbitmq.com/download.html>`_)

Note: Pika should be automatically installed when installing Rmqtools

Rmqtools is not currently available for download with PyPI. Once it is
available, it can be installed via pip::

    pip install rmqtools

To install the latest version before Rmqtools is available on PyPI, use the
latest_ release on GitHub and download ``rmqtools-<version>-py3-none-any.whl``.
Then install the wheel file with pip::

    pip install rmqtools-<version>-py3-none-any.whl

To install directly from source, run "python setup.py install" in the root
source directory.
